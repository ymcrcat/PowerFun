native-activity-example
=======================

#### Overview
A simple example of just using the Native Activity in Android without JNI / Java code.


#### Usage
Compile using the NDK tool "ndk-build" in the directory, you can easily create a APK by importing the project into Eclipse and selecting Run As > Android application.

#### Purpose
A simple boilerplate for native development in Android.

#### TODO
1. Improve the init_display method, currently uses the stock Google example code
2. Add some more interesting drawing, currently just clears the red
3. Look into licensing, will most likely use Apache 2
